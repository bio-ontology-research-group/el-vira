EL Vira is a set of tools to process OWL ontologies.

To run any of the scripts, you need Groovy
(http://groovy.codehaus.org) installed and the OWL API
(http://owlapi.sourceforge.net/), Pellet
(http://clarkparsia.com/pellet/), HermiT (http://hermit-reasoner.com/)
and FaCT++ (http://code.google.com/p/factplusplus/) JAR files in your
Java classpath.


MakeElWithReasoning.groovy
--------------------------
This script converts OWL ontologies into OWL EL, QL or RL. It performs
a classification of the OWL ontologies to maintain infered subclass
assertions and class restrictions.

To run, type:
groovy MakeElWithReasoning.groovy
and follow the instructions.

MakeEl.groovy
-------------
This script converts OWL ontologies into OWL EL. It performs no
classification of the OWL ontologies, but rather converts them
directly based on the asserted axioms.

To run, type:
groovy MakeEl.groovy
and follow the instructions.

isEl.groovy
-----------
This script can be used to detect if an ontology is represented in the
OWL EL subset of OWL. It uses both the OWLAPI and the Pellet reasoner
in order to identify whether an OWL ontologies complies with the
official specification of OWL EL and whether it would be recognized by
Pellet as an OWL EL ontology.

To run, type:
groovy isEl.groovy
and follow the instructions.

GenerateInferredOntology.groovy
--------------------------------
This script generates an inferred view of an ontology.

To run, type:
groovy GenerateInferredOntology.groovy
and follow the instructions.

TimingEval.groovy
-----------------
This script performs an evaluation of the performance of a reasoner
for classification and querying.

To run, type:
groovy TimingEval.groovy
and follow the instructions.
